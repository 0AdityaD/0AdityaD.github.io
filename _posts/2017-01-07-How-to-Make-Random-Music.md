I decided to experiment with random music generation this week using markov chains, a concept I encountered in my data structures class. There are a lot of references out there for random music generation using markov chains on .midi files so I decided to try it out on wav files (mp3 are compressed so that would be impractical). The idea of markov based music generation is to create music that is based off of an input music file. This is done by analyzing trends of music that follows other sequences of music. An obvious issue was that wav files are gigantic - a 6 minute song can exceed 60 MB of data. So performing markov based analysis on such songs isn't instantaneous. I wrote a script that takes as input a wav file and performs a randomization to create a wav file of arbitrary size. A link to the script is [here](https://github.com/0AdityaD/markovmusic/blob/master/generate.py).

Markov chains are a sequence of variables where the next value is dependent on the previous value. They can be visualized as graphs as shown below.
